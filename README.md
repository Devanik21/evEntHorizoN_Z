# ♾️  — A Voyage into Cosmic Intelligence

> _"Beyond the event horizon lies understanding. Beyond understanding lies Infinity."_ 🌌

## 🌀 Overview

**Infinity** is an **AI-powered Streamlit application** that merges human curiosity with cosmic intelligence.  
It’s not just another chatbot — it’s a **black hole of knowledge**, pulling in your thoughts, documents, and images,  
and returning insights that shimmer like starlight from the other side.

Built on **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**, Infinity lets you **chat with the universe** itself —  
answering your questions with scientific depth, philosophical wonder, and aesthetic calm.

## 🌠 Core Concept

Infinity embodies three intertwined principles:

1. **Silence of Space** – minimalist design, where the absence of noise enhances focus.  
2. **Gravity of Thought** – deep contextual intelligence that bends meaning like light around a black hole.  
3. **Eternal Memory** – a database of every cosmic conversation, stored in time with TinyDB.

Each chat is a **cosmic session** — a unique thread in the expanding fabric of your exploration.

Infinity’s interface mirrors a **black hole’s event horizon** —  
light fades, thoughts bend, and the interface itself becomes spacetime.
